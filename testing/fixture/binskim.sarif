Spectre attacks can compromise hardware-based isolation, allowing non-privileged users to retrieve potentially sensitive data from the CPU cache. To resolve the issue, provide the /Qspectre switch on the compiler command-line (or /d2guardspecload in cases where your compiler supports this switch and it is not possible to update to a toolset that supports /Qspectre). This warning should be addressed for code that operates on data that crosses a trust boundary and that can affect execution, such as parsing untrusted file inputs or processing query strings of a web request.\r\n{1}"
